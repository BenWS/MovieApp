Current process

1. Get Movie ID
2. Get count of movies with that particular movie ID
3. Provide that count to the New Movie Confirmation Page

Need to retrieve Movie Copy ID immediately creating new record - how to do so?

1. Find Java method that returns results of insert statement.
2. Find SQL construct that returns the result of of an insert statement.
3. Select the most recent Movie Copy record immediately after creating new record - last option.
4. Override the auto-increment to get the Movie Copy ID BEFORE creating new record.

Hi,

I'm creating an movie database application which allows the user to keep track of movie records.

My database for the application has a two tables:

Movies - For general information: Movie ID, movie title, director, movie release date
MovieCopy - Specific information on each *copy* of the movie: Movie Copy ID, true/false availability field

One part of the application allows the user to create a new movie *copy* record. The workflow goes like this:

1. Get Movie ID from movie title/MovieID key-value mapping
2. Insert new Movie *Copy* Record with that Movie ID

When I'm performing the record insert, I would like to obtain the ID of the new Movie Copy record immediately after the insert is complete. I'm unsure of an accurate way to do this - what I've considered doing:

1. Use Java method that returns results of insert statement - cannot find 
2. Find SQL construct that returns the result of of an insert statement.
3. Select the most recent Movie Copy record immediately after creating new record - last option.
4. Override the auto-increment to get the Movie Copy ID BEFORE creating new record.

EDIT: Found the answer in another Stack Overflow Question:
